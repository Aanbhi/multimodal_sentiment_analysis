Multimodal Sentiment Intelligence Platform for Dynamic Market Insights
Introduction
Understanding market sentiment in real-time is essential for businesses to make data-driven decisions. Traditional sentiment analysis methods often fail to integrate diverse data modalities effectively. This project addresses the challenge by developing an AI-driven Multimodal Sentiment Intelligence Platform, combining text and visual data to enhance sentiment understanding and market trend analysis.

Objectives
1. Develop an AI-powered sentiment analysis platform for real-time market insights.

2. Utilize Deep Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Multimodal Fusion techniques for improved sentiment interpretation.

3. Provide business intelligence insights for marketing, finance, and customer service applications.

Methodology

Model Architecture & Approach

1. Text Sentiment Analysis-Implemented BERT and GPT-2 for sentiment classification of textual data.

2. Visual Sentiment Analysis-Integrated YOLOv8 for object detection and DeepFace for facial emotion recognition.

3. Multimodal Fusion Strategies-Applied Feature-Level Fusion and Decision-Level Fusion techniques to improve accuracy.

4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-Used RAG-based models for context-aware sentiment insights, improving interpretability.

Deployment-The platform is designed for scalable deployment with:

1.Backend: Flask/FastAPI

2.Frontend: Streamlit

3.Model Hosting: Hugging Face / TensorFlow Serving

4.Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

5.Cloud Deployment: AWS/GCP

Use Cases-
1.Real-time social media sentiment tracking for brands and businesses.

2.Financial market sentiment analysis for stock predictions.

3.Customer feedback analysis to enhance customer service.
